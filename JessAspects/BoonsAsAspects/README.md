# All Weapons ★ Boons as Aspects.

Did you know that weapon aspects are traits, and are thus in the same category as boons (and much more)? Well, this submodule adds an 'aspect' to each weapon which, instead of *functioning* like a different weapon, bestows you with a boon!

Unfortunately, these boons don't really expect to be bestowed in this manner, so... bug testing ahead.

## Aspects
- [x] Stygian Blade ★ Poseidon's Flourish
- [ ] Eternal Spear ★ Hades' Call
- [ ] Shield of Chaos ★ Chaos' Favor
- [ ] Heart-Seeking Bow ★ Artemis' Cast
- [ ] Twin Fists ★ Demeter's Strike
- [ ] Adamant Rail ★ Hermes' Evasion

### TODO
- [x] A variety of boons, one for each weapon.
- [x] Writing dramatic README stuff
- [x] fix weapon animations to be more apt (chaos aspect visuals for chaos' favor shield, etc)
- [ ] Debugging
  - [ ] Rarity progression doesn't really expect 5 levels
    - [x] Which boons expect what?
    - [x] Do you want to make them go to 5 levels, or reduce the levels available to upgrade?
    - [ ] I think it would work best to make duplicate versions of the aspects that can be edited. they will go up to Legendary.
      - completion: 1/6
  - [ ] Traits don't expect to need text to display on the weapon aspect selection/upgrade screen. Implement that text.
    - completion: 0/6
  - [ ] I think Artemis steals your ability to cast if she gets annoyed with you.
  - [ ] I wonder what happens if you equip Hades' keepsake while also having the call?
