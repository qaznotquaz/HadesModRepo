# Adamant Rail ★ Aspect of Annie Oakley.

*Inspired by the famous markswoman Annie Oakley, the Aspect of Annie is a combo- and crit- focused aspect for the Adamant Rail.*

> Your single-shot rifle's **Critical** dislodges **Bloodstone** from foes.
> 
> **Critical Attack** Chance: 3%/6%/9%/12%/15%
> 
> **Sharp Aim** Bonus **Critical** Chance: 8%/10%/12%/14%/16%
> 
> *Flavor text unwritten.*

> **Sharp Aim**
> Foes targeted by your **Special** are more vulnerable to **Critical** hits.

### Hammer Changes

Because of the max ammo change, the following hammers have been changed as well.
#### Spread Fire -> Slug Fire
> Your **Attack** deals **55** base damage and shoves foes back; your reload is **150%** slower.

#### Flurry Fire -> Trick Combo
*unimplemented. building a combo increases critical hit chance. i might look into incorporating this into the main weapon?*

#### Delta Chamber -> TBD
*unsure. the increased fire rate is a little busted with an increased critical chance*
