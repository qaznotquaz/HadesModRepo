## Adamant Rail â˜… Aspect of Jess

*Inspired by the mod creator themselves, this is a cast-focused variation of the Adamant Rail which makes use of the Flare casts that are typically only used by the Aspect of Beowulf.*

> Your **Cast** loads **Bloodstone** into your next **Special**, firing on impact.
> Levelling bonus unimplemented.
> *Usually nonviolent, this mod creator does have a flair for the dramatic.*
