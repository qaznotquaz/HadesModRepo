# Jess' Aspects ★ WIP
*By [fallen_angel.js](https://twitch.tv/qaznotquaz "come watch me on twitch!"), aka `qaznotquaz#3300`*

## Abstract
I had some ideas for new aspects and wanted to implement them - both as a way to give my two cents to the community, and to get my feet wet with understanding how modding this game really works. Hopefully I'm not getting *too* in over my head!

## Usage
***★ it works! doesn't do a lot, though ★***

Requires [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27) and [Aspect Fusion](https://github.com/PonyWarrior/HadesModRepo/tree/master/AspectFusion).

Install using [ModImporter](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26).

[`config.lua`](config.lua) has options for enabling or disabling any given Aspect.

## Aspects
- *Under Construction*
  - [Adamant Rail ★ Annie Oakley](LittleSureshot)
- *Undetermined*
  - [Adamant Rail ★ TBD](undetermined)
- *Under Consideration*
  - Heart-Seeking Bow ★ Cleopatra
  - Twin Fists ★ Mike Tyson
  - Eternal Spear ★ Merlin

## General TODO
- [x] **★ Implement extended aspect menu from [AspectFusion](https://github.com/PonyWarrior/HadesModRepo/tree/master/AspectFusion)**
  - *keeping in mind he'll be breaking this functionality into its own mod in due time*
- [x] Write the README
- [ ] Look for QA and balance testers?
