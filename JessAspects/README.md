# Jess' Aspects ★ WIP
*By [fallen_angel.js](https://twitch.tv/qaznotquaz "come watch me on twitch!"), aka `qaznotquaz#3300`*

## Abstract
I had some ideas for new aspects and wanted to implement them - both as a way to give my two cents to the community, and to get my feet wet with understanding how modding this game really works. Hopefully I'm not getting *too* in over my head!

## Usage
***★ it works! doesn't do a lot, though ★***

#### Requirements
- MagicGonads' [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27)
- PonyWarrior's [Aspect Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/115)
- My [MimicUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/117/)

Install using [ModImporter](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26).

to enable/disable particular submodules, comment out their **Include** statement in the [`modfile.txt`](modfile.txt). each module also may have its own configuration options, available from their corresponding `config.lua` file. alternatively, any subfolder or sub-subfolder which has a `modfile.txt` can be used as a self-contained mod.
