# Jess' Aspects ★ WIP
*By [fallen_angel.js](https://twitch.tv/qaznotquaz "come watch me on twitch!"), aka `qaznotquaz#3300`*

## Abstract
I had some ideas for new aspects and wanted to implement them - both as a way to give my two cents to the community, and to get my feet wet with understanding how modding this game really works. Hopefully I'm not getting *too* in over my head!

## Usage
***★ it works! doesn't do a lot, though ★***

Requires [ModUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/27) and [MimicUtil](../MimicUtil).

Also requires PonyWarrior's *as of yet unreleased* [Aspect Fusion](https://github.com/PonyWarrior/HadesModRepo/tree/master/AspectFusion) mod. It's so cool, though.

Install using [ModImporter](https://www.nexusmods.com/hades/mods/26).

to enable/disable particular submodules, comment out their **Include** statement in the [`modfile.txt`](modfile.txt). each module also may have its own configuration options, available from their corresponding `config.lua` file. alternatively, you can use each submodule as a self-contained mod!

<!-- i don't want to step out of line so i'll wait til i have more completed before asking permission, but i wonder if i could set up raisins' swarm missiles as a separate aspect? -->
