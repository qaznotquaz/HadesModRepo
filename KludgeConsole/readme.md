# KludgeConsole

a development tool for running lua commands and scripts while the game is running.

### requirements
- requires modutil
- install with modimporter

please don't use this if you don't know what you're doing. in fairness, by that metric, i myself shouldn't be using this but who's counting, really.

### use
edit `kludgefile.lua` - this is where you'll type your code in lieu of a real command prompt. to execute the code in here, press `Shout` + `Reload` (default `F` + `R`) while in the game.
